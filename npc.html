            <h4 class="headings">Who are We?</h4>
            <p>We are a small group of people who enjoy tabletop role-playing games.</p>
            <h4 class="headings">What the Hell is a Tabletop Role-Playing Game?</h4>
            <p>A tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) is a type of RPG where players participate in adventures through speech and imagination according to a set of rules.
            A designated game master (GM) describes the setting and controls non-player characters (NPCs), while each of the other players controls a player character (PC) by acting out their actions.
            The strength of tabletop RPGs is in the freedom of improvisation and potentially unlimited ability to shape outcomes. Additionally, it is a fun communal experience to share with friends.</p>
            <p>For more information, please, look up the corresponding article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">Wikipedia</a> or a short and sweet intro on 
            <a href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Introduction_To_Tabletop_RPGs">Roll20</a> - a dedicated online service for TRPG players.</p>
            <h4 class="headings">So, What is This Website About?</h4>
            <p>This website is dedicated to a particular campaign based on the "Doomsday Dawn" mini-adventure path published by Paizo Publishing LLC as part of the playtest of the upcoming Pathfinder 2 ruleset.
            The aim of the playtest is to try out a new system and provide creators with feedback that will let them iron out the kinks for the final version, which is due to come out in the summer of 2019.
            All of the relevant materials are available in pdf format free of charge on <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest">Paizo website</a>.</p>
            <p>Although this website is intended for the use of players, feel free to browse and tell us what you think!</p>
