                <p id="session-2" class="handwritten">The initial success in the Ashen Ossuary embolden some members of the party but scare the others. Sator, Gunthar, and Druwits (with Beithir, of course) are the ones who decide to push forward.<br>
                Upon their entry into Mudchewer Central, they quickly realise that they have company - a small group of goblins building a ten-foot tall statue. Once the goblins notice the party, they leave their task and attack.
                Less violence-inclined party members try to parley, but the little creatures don't seem to speak Common. In the end, they have to be dispatched.<br>
                The party passes entrances to three suspicious caves without entering and zero in on the steps towards what looks like a desecrated entry chamber at a shrine. In their eagerness, they sound goblins' crude alarm when they enter.<br>
                As a cleric, Sator cannot let the filthiness of Lamashtu's curse stay. After channeling positive energy confirms the source to be inside the fountain, he dives in and grabs the statue. In the ensuing fight with two quasits,
                he makes use of it as a hand-held battering tool, further enraging the demons. In the end, it almost costs him his life. Meanwhile, Gunthar has much luck in setting one of quasits on fire, while Druwits and Beithir make a few well-placed hits.</p>
